# Professional README Generator Starter Code

[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)

I have created a command line application to generate a high-quality README.md file.

My motivation was to complete a back end application and gain that experience.

I created this application because the need was for a generator to create README.md files.\

I learned about using Node and the integrated terminal within VS code to create an application with multiple steps and parts.

My application stands out because it generates a high-quality README.md file efficiently.

INSTALLATION:

Open the project in VS code.

Open the integrated terminal.

Enter node index.js to start the file.

See the following screenshot for an example of the preview of the README created within the command line:
